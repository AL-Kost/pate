## How to Use

### Loading a Book

</div>

1. Click the "Upload an FB2, EPUB, or ZIP" button in the sidebar.
2. Select your book file (supported formats: .fb2, .epub, .zip).
3. Wait for the file to process.

You can also use 'drag&drop' feature to load your book.
### Navigating Chapters
<div align="center">

</div>

1. Use the chapter dropdown in the sidebar to select your desired chapter.
2. The content will automatically update with the original text and translation.

### Reading with Translation
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/translate_feature.gif" alt="Loading file demonstration" width="800"/>
</div>

- Original text appears on the left.
- AI-translated text appears on the right.
- Translations are generated in real-time as you navigate through the content.

## Configuration

You can modify the translation settings in `src/app_config.py`:
```Python
OLLAMA_MODEL = "aya-expanse:32b-q4_K_M" # Change the AI model
TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE = "Russian" # Change target language
TRANSLATION_PROMPT = "Translate this text to {language}, don't say anything else: {text} \n{language}:" #Change prompt
```

The main translation logic is stored in `src/utils/llm_translator`. You can modify this file if necessary (e.g. use OpenAI API for translation).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit 1.39.0
- ebooklib 0.18
- beautifulsoup4 4.12.3
- Ollama 0.4.2+

Also, you need a machine that can handle Ollama running your selected LLM. In my case, it was a PC with an RTX 3090.
